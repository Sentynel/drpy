# DRPY

This is a standalone, free Python implementation of the Dynamic Range (DR) algorithm first
implemented in the "TT Dynamic Range Meter". It should produce nearly identical results to other
implementations, including the original, the Foobar2000 plugin, and more recent paid versions of
the DR meter.
